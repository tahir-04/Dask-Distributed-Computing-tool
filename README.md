# Distributed Computing – Parallel & Scalable Processing (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the **core principles of Distributed Computing** using Python.  
It focuses on how computational tasks can be **divided, executed in parallel, and aggregated efficiently** to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

The implementation is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to understand, experiment with, and extend.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
Modern systems at companies like **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix** rely heavily on distributed systems.  
This project showcases:
- Understanding of **parallelism**
- Efficient **task distribution**
- Performance-aware system design
- Practical Python-based implementation

This is **not just theory** — it is a working, executable model.

## ⚙️ How It Works (High-Level)
1. A large computational task is **split into smaller sub-tasks**
2. Each sub-task is assigned to a **separate worker process**
3. Workers execute tasks **in parallel**
4. Results are **collected and combined**
5. Final output is produced with improved efficiency
